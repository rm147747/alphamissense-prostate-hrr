## Reproducibility

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/rm147747/alphamissense-prostate-hrr.git
cd alphamissense-prostate-hrr

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run notebooks in order
jupyter notebook Notebook1_AlphaMissense_PRAD_HRR.ipynb
```

### Environment

- **Python:** 3.12.3
- **Random seed:** 42 (set globally in every notebook)
- **Data access date:** February 16, 2026
- **Key packages:** pandas 2.3.3, lifelines 0.30.1, scikit-learn 1.8.0, scipy 1.17.0

All package versions are pinned in `requirements.txt`. A complete reproducibility manifest including data access dates and random seeds is in `manifest.json`.

### Notebook Execution Order

Notebooks must be run in order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4), as each depends on outputs from the previous:

1. **Notebook 1:** Downloads TCGA-PRAD mutations, filters HRR missense variants, annotates with AlphaMissense
2. **Notebook 2:** Compares AlphaMissense with ClinVar, computes concordance metrics, reclassifies VUS
3. **Notebook 3:** Applies pipeline to SU2C/PCF mCRPC cohort (exploratory feasibility)
4. **Notebook 4:** Pan-cancer analysis across 31 TCGA tumor types with survival analysis

## AlphaMissense Classification Rule

AlphaMissense provides **pre-computed categorical labels** (`benign`, `ambiguous`, `pathogenic`) directly from the model output. This pipeline uses these labels as-is — **no custom thresholds are applied**.

| Classification | Score range | Source |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| Benign | am_pathogenicity < 0.34 | AlphaMissense TSV column 4 |
| Ambiguous | 0.34 ≤ score ≤ 0.564 | AlphaMissense TSV column 4 |
| Pathogenic | score > 0.564 | AlphaMissense TSV column 4 |

The thresholds were calibrated by [Cheng et al. (Science 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg7492) to achieve 90% precision on ClinVar pathogenic variants. A full classification specification is available in `results/classification_spec.json`.

**Patient-level derivation:** `has_am_pathogenic = True` if ≥1 variant has `am_class == "pathogenic"` (defined in Notebook 1, Cell 22).

## Statistical Methods

- **Primary analysis:** True stratified Cox model (strata = tumor type; separate baseline hazards)
- **Meta-analysis:** Fixed-effect inverse-variance + REML random-effects + Hartung–Knapp CI + prediction interval
- **Concordance:** Cohen's κ with 2,000-iteration bootstrap 95% CI
- **Sensitivity:** Event threshold (≥3/5/10), ridge penalty sweep (λ = 0.001–0.5)

## Limitations & Intended Use

> **⚠️ This analysis is hypothesis-generating and NOT intended for clinical decision-making.**

- AlphaMissense predictions are **computational annotations**, not clinical reclassifications per ACMG/AMP standards.
- The VUS "reclassification" reported here is a **computational triage** — it does not replace expert curation, functional assays, or clinical-grade variant interpretation.
- Survival analysis is **univariate** (no adjustment for age, stage, treatment, or other confounders) and should be interpreted as associative, not causal.
- For clinical use, AlphaMissense scores should be considered as **PP3/BP4-level supporting evidence** within the ACMG/AMP framework, not as standalone determinants.
- Prospective clinical validation is required before integration into treatment decisions.
